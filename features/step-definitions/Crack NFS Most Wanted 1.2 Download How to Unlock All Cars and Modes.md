Companies like Google, however, have been investing in their own fiber networks and creating their own backbones that bypass the telecoms. This could mean that Google was only a partial competitor in the market and NSA wanted to have more access to their traffic. Another possibility is that this was a strategy to increase trust in U.S. products by making most users of their capabilities believe that NSA was obtaining data through hacking and eavesdropping rather than through backdoors. It could also be a combination of both reasons or something else entirely. ð

One of the sources that revealed the NSA's tapping of Google's fiber links was Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the agency who leaked classified documents to the media in 2013. Snowden claimed that he was motivated by his conscience and his desire to expose the NSA's violations of privacy and civil liberties. He also said that he hoped to spark a public debate about the role and limits of surveillance in a democratic society.
  
However, not everyone agreed with Snowden's actions or his views. Some critics argued that he was a traitor who endangered national security and put lives at risk. They also questioned his credibility and his motives, suggesting that he was working for a foreign power or seeking fame and fortune. They also defended the NSA's programs as necessary and lawful measures to protect the country from terrorist threats and cyberattacks.

The controversy over the NSA's surveillance activities and Snowden's revelations has raised many ethical, legal, and political questions. How much privacy should individuals have in the digital age? How much power should the government have to monitor and collect data from private companies and citizens? How can we balance security and liberty in a complex and interconnected world? How can we hold the government accountable for its actions and ensure transparency and oversight? These are some of the questions that we need to address as a society.
  
Since the NSA's surveillance activities and Snowden's revelations became public, there have been some changes and reforms in the U.S. and around the world. For example, in 2015, the U.S. Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which ended the bulk collection of phone records by the NSA and imposed new restrictions and oversight on its programs. The act also created a panel of independent experts to advise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approves the NSA's requests for data.
  
Another example is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in 2018. The GDPR is a comprehensive set of rules that governs how personal data is collected, processed, and shared by companies and organizations in the EU and beyond. The GDPR aims to give individuals more control and rights over their data, such as the right to access, correct, delete, or transfer their data. The GDPR also imposes strict penalties for data breaches and violations.
  
However, these changes and reforms are not enough to resolve the issues and challenges posed by the NSA's surveillance activities and Snowden's revelations. There are still many gaps and loopholes in the laws and regulations that govern surveillance and data protection. There are also many conflicts and tensions between different countries and regions over how to handle data flows and requests. There are also many technical and practical difficulties in implementing and enforcing the rules and standards. Moreover, there are still many unknowns and uncertainties about the extent and impact of the NSA's surveillance activities and Snowden's revelations.
