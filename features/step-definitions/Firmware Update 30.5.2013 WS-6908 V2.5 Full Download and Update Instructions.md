## Step 1: Download the Firmware File
 
The first step is to download the firmware file from the official website of Satlink. You can find the link to the firmware file in the Facebook post by Update Firmware[^1^]. The file name is `satlink_ws_6908_firmware_update_v2_5_0.zip` and it was updated on December 25, 2020.
 
Alternatively, you can also download the firmware file from other sources, such as Vidyakansha[^2^] or SoundCloud[^3^], but make sure they are trustworthy and have the same file name and date.
 
Once you have downloaded the firmware file, unzip it and copy it to your USB flash drive. Make sure the USB flash drive is formatted in FAT32 and has enough space for the file.
 
## Step 2: Connect the USB Flash Drive to Your Satellite Finder
 
The next step is to connect the USB flash drive to your satellite finder. Turn off your satellite finder and plug the USB flash drive into its USB port. Then turn on your satellite finder and wait for it to boot up.
 
On the main menu of your satellite finder, select `Tools` and then `Upgrade by USB`. You should see a list of files on your USB flash drive. Select the firmware file that you copied earlier and press `OK`. A confirmation message will appear asking you if you want to upgrade. Press `Yes` to start the upgrade process.
 
## Step 3: Wait for the Upgrade Process to Complete
 
The upgrade process may take several minutes, depending on the size of the firmware file and the speed of your USB flash drive. Do not turn off your satellite finder or remove the USB flash drive during this time, as this may damage your device or cause errors.
 
You will see a progress bar on the screen showing you how much of the upgrade has been completed. When the upgrade is finished, your satellite finder will restart automatically and display a message saying `Upgrade Success`.
