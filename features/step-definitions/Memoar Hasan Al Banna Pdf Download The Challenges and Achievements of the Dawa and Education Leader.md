Hassan al-Banna was born on 14 October 1906, in the village of Mahmudiyah, in the Beheira province of Egypt. He came from a humble family of devout Muslims. His father, Sheikh Ahmad al-Banna, was an imam, a muezzin, and a teacher at the local mosque, who instilled in his son a strong religious and moral upbringing. Hassan al-Banna memorized the entire Qur'an by the age of 12 and joined the Society for Moral Behaviour, a local religious group that aimed to reform society through Islamic teachings. [^2^] [^3^]
 
In 1923, Hassan al-Banna enrolled at the Dar al-Ulum, a teacher-training college in Cairo that followed a traditional religious and social outlook. He was influenced by the reformist ideas of Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida, who advocated for a revival of Islam based on rationalism and modernity. He also admired the anti-colonial struggle of Shaykh Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Syrian-Palestinian leader who fought against the British and French mandates in Syria and Palestine. [^2^]
 
In 1927, Hassan al-Banna was assigned to teach Arabic in a primary school in Ismailia, near the Suez Canal, which was a strategic area under British control. There he witnessed the exploitation and oppression of the Egyptian workers by the foreign powers and their local collaborators. He also observed the moral decadence and corruption of the Egyptian society that had lost its Islamic identity and values. He felt the need to establish a new religious movement that would revive Islam and reform society according to its principles. [^2^]
