## Vision and Mission
 
Shivaji had a clear vision and mission for his empire. He wanted to establish a Hindu kingdom that would be free from the oppression of the Mughals and other foreign invaders. He also wanted to create a prosperous and harmonious society that would respect the rights and dignity of all people. He communicated his vision and mission to his followers and inspired them to join his cause.
 
Modern managers can learn from Shivaji's example of having a clear vision and mission for their organizations. A vision is a long-term goal that describes what the organization wants to achieve in the future. A mission is a short-term objective that defines how the organization will achieve its vision. Having a clear vision and mission helps managers to align their actions with their values, motivate their employees, and attract customers and stakeholders.
 
## Organizational Structure
 
Shivaji had a well-defined organizational structure for his empire. He divided his territory into provinces, districts, and villages, each with its own administrative head. He also created a council of eight ministers, called the Ashtapradhan, who were responsible for different aspects of governance, such as finance, defense, justice, and foreign affairs. He delegated authority and responsibility to his subordinates and held them accountable for their performance.
 
Modern managers can learn from Shivaji's example of having a well-defined organizational structure for their organizations. An organizational structure is a system that defines how tasks are divided, coordinated, and controlled within an organization. Having a well-defined organizational structure helps managers to clarify roles and responsibilities, improve communication and coordination, enhance efficiency and effectiveness, and foster innovation and creativity.
 
## Human Resource Development
 
Shivaji had a strong focus on human resource development for his empire. He recruited talented and loyal people from various backgrounds and regions, regardless of their caste or religion. He trained them in various skills, such as warfare, administration, diplomacy, and intelligence. He also rewarded them with titles, honors, land grants, and salaries. He encouraged them to voice their opinions and suggestions and respected their diversity and individuality.
 
Modern managers can learn from Shivaji's example of having a strong focus on human resource development for their organizations. Human resource development is the process of improving the knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitudes of employees to enhance their performance and potential. Having a strong focus on human resource development helps managers to attract and retain talent, improve employee engagement and satisfaction, increase productivity and quality, and foster learning and growth.
